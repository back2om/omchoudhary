        My name is Om Choudhary, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Chakra Chennubhotla’s group at University of Pittsburgh. I graduated from the joint CMU-Pitt Ph.D. program in computational biology where I investigated the permeation properties of the membrane protein - Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (mVDAC1). The channel constitutes a major pathway for transferring metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane. I used continuum electrostatic methods (Poisson-Boltzmann and Poisson-Nernst-Planck calculations) and Markov State Model (MSM) to show that the mVDAC1 x-ray crystal structure is anion selective and has high ATP flux – both properties of the open state of the channel.

        In addition to my work on ion channels, I am also quite interested in computational chemistry and drug design. In 2010, I was selected for a competitive internship at GlaxoSmithKline in Philadelphia, where I evaluated various statistical mechanical computational tools for predicting “hotspots” in protein active sites. In addition to this, I worked at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. where I designed, developed, and implemented a high-level fully automated Python application for quantum calculations of NMR chemical shifts.
